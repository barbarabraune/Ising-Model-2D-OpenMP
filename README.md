# Ising-Model-2D-OpenMP
This repository presents an attempt to parallelize the 2D Ising Model using OpenMP 

The bidimensional Ising Model is a model used in statistical physics for a magnetic material that aims to simulate magnetic systems. The name "Ising Model" was firstly conceived in 1936 by R. Peierls in his work: On Ising's Model of Ferromagnetism. This model consists of classical spins in a discrete, equally spaced grid in two dimensions that contain a set of spin degrees of freedom interacting with each other and with an external magnetic field. In this model, the rotations are at an L-size 2D grid, and the spins can be up or down.
